    //JavaScript statements are composed of:

    //Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
    Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
    JavaScript ignores multiple spaces

    <p>to create and use variable : </p>

    <script>
        //create variable
        var p;
        let q;
        // use variable

        p = 7;
        q = 7;
        let r = p+q;
    </script>

    <p>js syntax ke pass 2 type ki value<br> fixed value = literals<br>variable values = variables</p>

    <p>literal/fisex value mae 2 aate ---- <br>numbers<br>string</p>
    <p>variable/varurable value store data values. KEYWORDS VAR LET CONST USED TO DECLARE VARIABLES. = TO ASSIGN VALUES</p>
    <P>avaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values,,JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables</P>
<p>An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

    The computation is called an evaluation.
    
    For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50</p>
    <p>JavaScript Keywords
        JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed. eg let var</p>
        <p>JavaScript Comments
            Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".eg / or /*</p>

            <p>Identifiers are JavaScript names.

                Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
                
                The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
                
                A JavaScript name must begin with:
                
                A letter (A-Z or a-z)
                A dollar sign ($)
                Or an underscore (_)</p>
          <p>JavaScript is Case Sensitive
            All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
            
            The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:</p>   
               <p>JavaScript and Camel Case
                Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:
                
                Hyphens:
                
                first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.
                
                Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
                
                Underscore:
                
                first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
                
                Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
                
                FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
                
                Lower Camel Case:
                
                JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
                
                firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
                
                JavaScript Character Set
                JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
                
                Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
